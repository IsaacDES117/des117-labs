                <p>
                    International House Davis (I-House) is a non-profit, community-based organization. The mission of I-House is to promote respect and appreciation for all people and cultures. We encourage a global community by providing many opportunities for cross-cultural interaction and exchange. I-House pursues these goals by providing programs, activities and services for international students and scholars, other international visitors, community members, businesses and academic institutions. We are not a part of UC Davis; however, we work closely with campus departments and we welcome not only students, but community members from throughout the area.

                <h3> OUR BACKGROUND </h3>
                <p>Until the late 1970s, International House Davis was only a dream, but Mr. and Mrs. Shunta Yamamoto of Tokyo arrived with aspirations of starting an institution to foster a cultural learning. With the help of the community, this dream was soon realized and the non-profit corporation was formally established in 1981. Then in 1983, the property at 10 College Park was acquired through a generous gift from the Yamamotos and the facility, now known as International House Davis, opened in March 1984.</p>
                <p>Since its inception, a working board of 15-20 volunteers has managed the facility and developed programs. For eight years the organization was guided by dedicated, part-time program directors. In 1990 the city of Davis and UC Davis granted I-House service contracts which allowed the board to hire a full-time executive director and office manager. The next year a volunteer coordinator was added.</p>
                <p>In 1989, I-House underwent a major renovation, and in 1993, volunteers contributed 2,300 hours to build the much-needed Hagan Conference Room. In 1997, a 3,300 sq. ft. south wing was added, greatly improving the organizationâ€™s ability to provide quality programs.
